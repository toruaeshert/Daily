I've recently become a lot more tired, esp. because school and stuff has been weighing down on me. 
This is just a place for me to put my thoughts that I feel throughout the day.
Today I looked in the mirror, and I think I saw how other people see me, not the way I see myself, and it scared me a little. Not because i'm scary or anything, but because I was kinda butt ugly. Didn't even turn off the water running in the sink or anything, just stood there, looking in the mirror for a little while. 
I really don't want to stop procrastinating on doing stuff, but I feel like by the time I start, it's too late. I have math homework due in an hour. I haven't started yet. I have a history test on Monday, and I haven't started yet. 
I sometimes want to commit something. Someone at my school tried to commit something today, and a bunch of teachers gathered around. I was wearing a bright orange sweater and I think someone else nearby who was involved was wearing a bright orange sweater, cause a guy came in during class and pointed at my sweater on the table and asked, "Who's is this?" 
He told me to come out and talk with him, and I pretty quickly proved I wasn't involved. I didn't even know what had happened at the time. 

I'm envious.
